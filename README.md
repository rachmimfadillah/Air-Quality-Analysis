# Air Quality Analysis in Beijing, China
This project analyzes the air quality data from 12 different districts in Beijing, China, collected by the PRSA (China National Environmental Monitoring Center) from 2013 to 2017. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the air quality in Beijing, identify trends over time, and compare the air quality across different districts.

# Data Source
The air quality data was obtained from the PRSA Data Archive, which includes hourly measurements of air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and O3, as well as weather data such as temperature and wind speed.

# Data Analysis
The data analysis was conducted using Python and various data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The analysis includes data cleaning and preprocessing and exploratory data analysis. The results of the analysis are presented in Jupyter notebooks, which can be found in the notebooks directory.
